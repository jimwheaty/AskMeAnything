# AskMeAnything
A Questions - Answers app that is offered as a Service (SaaS) for our 2021 SaaS course at NTUA.

### main
An informative, non-functional branch.

### soa-localhost
A SOA-version of the app deployed locally.

### frontend-mvc-heroku
A MVC-version of the app deployed on Heroku (frontend).

### backend-mvc
A MVC-version of the app deployed on Heroku (backend).

Note that Heroku free plan can only run a single process for each project. For this reason we needed two separate branches to push to heroku in order to deploy our app.
